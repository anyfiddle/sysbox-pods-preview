# Kubernetes Cluster Preparation for Sysbox

This document describes how to prepare a Kubernetes cluster prior
to installing Sysbox.

These steps do not include the installation of Sysbox itself, which is
done easily via a daemonset as described in the [README file](../README.md#sysbox-installation).

The steps are mainly to ensure the nodes have the required OS distro, K8s has
the required version, and that the worker nodes where Sysbox will be installed
use CRI-O as the runtime.

## K8s Master Node Setup

Sysbox requires a Kubernetes cluster with version 1.20.\*.

The cluster should have at least two nodes, one acting as a master and one or
more worker nodes. Sysbox should be installed on the worker nodes only (i.e., we
don't recommend it to be installed on the master nodes for reasons described later).

To setup such a cluster with `kubeadm`, you can run the following
command on the control plane node(s):

```console
sudo swapoff -a
sudo kubeadm init --kubernetes-version=v1.20.2 --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

Since the K8s master node won't be running Sysbox pods, no further Sysbox related
preparations are required on it. The preparations are mainly on the K8s worker nodes
where Sysbox will be installed.

## K8s Worker Node Setup

The worker node setup is composed of the following steps:

1.  Install Ubuntu Focal or Bionic (with a 5.0+ kernel) on the node.

2.  Install the shiftfs kernel module (recommended if host's volumes are required).

3.  Install [rsync](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=rsync) on the node.

4.  Install CRI-O

The sections below describe each of these in detail.

## Installing Ubuntu Focal or Bionic

Make sure your worker node host has Ubuntu Focal (20.04) or Ubuntu Bionic
(18.04).

The kernel should be >= 5.0. If using Ubuntu Bionic and the kernel is < 5.0, you
can upgrade it with:

```console
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-18.04 -y
```

## Installing Shiftfs on a K8s Worker Node

Shiftfs is a kernel module that perform user-ID and group-ID "shifting". It's
needed if you will be mounting host files or directories onto pods created with
K8s + Sysbox (i.e., hostPath volumes). If you won't be mounting hostPath volumes
onto Sysbox pods, shiftfs is not required.

Shiftfs comes by default in Ubuntu desktop and server versions, but
unfortunately it's not included in cloud versions (e.g., Ubuntu AWS AMIs). You
can run `modinfo shiftfs` on a host to verify its presence. If shiftfs is
included, then you don't have to do anything else. If it's not included, you can
install it manually.

It's pretty easy to install shiftfs as there is a dynamic kernel module (DKMS)
here: https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms

*   NOTE: shiftfs is only supported on Ubuntu-based kernels at this time. Even if
    you manage to build and install it on non-Ubuntu kernels, Ubuntu carries other
    kernel patches (e.g., overlayfs) that enable proper interaction with
    shiftfs. Without those patches shiftfs won't work well as used by Sysbox.

For example, to manually build and install shiftfs on a Ubuntu-based host with a
5.4 kernel, these are the instructions (as described in the web-page referenced
above):

```console
apt-get install -y git make dkms
git clone -b k5.4 https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms.git shiftfs-k54
cd shiftfs-k54
./update1
sudo make -f Makefile.dkms
```

If all is well, then `modinfo shiftfs` should show that shiftfs is present
on the host:

```console
$ modinfo shiftfs
filename:       /lib/modules/5.4.0-71-generic/kernel/fs/shiftfs.ko
license:        GPL v2
description:    id shifting filesystem
author:         Christian Brauner <christian.brauner@ubuntu.com>
author:         Seth Forshee <seth.forshee@canonical.com>
author:         James Bottomley
...
```

## Installing rsync on a K8s worker node

Rsync is used by Sysbox for efficient data transfers inside the host (rsync data is
never copied outside the host).

Install rsync with:

    sudo apt-get install rsync

## Installing CRI-O on a K8s Worker Node

CRI-O is a light-weight container manager/runtime developed specifically for K8s
(primarily by RedHat). It's a lighter alternative to the heavier containerd.

CRI-O logically sits between the Kubelet and low-level container runtimes such as
Sysbox. When deploying a pod, the K8s control plane sends an instruction to the
Kubelet on a node, and Kubelet sends the instruction to CRI-O. CRI-O then works
with the low-level runtime (e.g., OCI runc or Sysbox) to create the pod.

CRI-O v1.20 introduces support for "rootless pods", meaning pods in which the
root user on the pod maps to an unprivileged user on the host via the Linux
user-namespace. This results in increased container isolation and is a key
feature required for creating pods with Sysbox.

Thus, CRI-O v1.20 is required on the K8s worker nodes where Sysbox will be
installed.

*   Do **NOT** install CRI-O versions earlier that v1.20, as they don't support
    rootless pods and thus won't work with Sysbox.

*   Do **NOT** install CRI-O v1.21 as it has a problem that breaks isolation in
    rootless pods (i.e., maps the pod's root user to the root user on the
    host). We are working to resolve this with the CRI-O developers.

### CRI-O Installation Steps

There are two ways to install CRI-O on a K8s worker node:

*   The easy way: using a daemonset written by Nestybox that installs CRI-O on the
    desired worker nodes. See [here](../README.md#cri-o-installation) for details.

*   The harder way: manually installing CRI-O and configuring the Kubelet. This
    is described below.

**NOTE: we recommend you use the CRI-O installation daemonset as it's not only easier,
but also makes Kubernetes install CRI-O on newly provisioned worker nodes.**

### Manual CRI-O Installation

If you don't wish to install CRI-O via the [daemonset](../README.md#cri-o-installation),
you can install CRI-O manually on the worker nodes where you want to run
Sysbox. This is more painful but gives you more control over the process. The
CRI-O installation daemonset essentially performs the steps below.

The installation steps for CRI-O are here: https://cri-o.io . For example, to
install CRI-O v1.20 on a Ubuntu-Focal (20.04) host follow these steps.

As root:

```console
VERSION=1.20
OS=xUbuntu_20.04

echo "deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list
echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable:/cri-o:/$VERSION/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.list

curl -L https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION/$OS/Release.key | apt-key add -
curl -L https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/Release.key | apt-key add -

apt-get update
apt-get install -y cri-o cri-o-runc

systemctl restart crio
```

If all is well, then the CRI-O systemd service unit should be running:

```console
$ systemctl status crio
‚óè crio.service - Container Runtime Interface for OCI (CRI-O)
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/crio.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2021-04-25 04:06:52 UTC; 2 days ago
       Docs: https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o
```

Note: the CRI-O log (`journalctl -u crio`) may show errors such as:

    Error validating CNI config ...
    The binary conntrack is not installed ...

Ignore these for now; they may occur when K8s is not yet installed on the node.

Next we will configure CRI-O, and later we will configure K8s to use CRI-O.

### CRI-O Configuration

In order to use CRI-O with K8s and Sysbox, you must make the following
configurations on the worker node:

1.  Add an entry for user `containers` to the `/etc/subuid` file on the host. For example:

```console
$ cat /etc/subuid
cesar:100000:65536
containers:165536:268435456
```

Make sure the subids don't overlap. Same applies to `/etc/subgid`.

When creating rootless pods, CRI-O will choose the Linux user-namespace ID
mappings from range of user "containers" in these files.

For example, it will map the user ID range \[0:65535] on the pod to the
unprivileged user ID range \[165536:231071] on the host. This way the processes
running in the pod will have permission to access resources inside the pod only.
Notice that since the `/etc/subuid` entry for user "containers" has a range of
268435456, CRI-O can map up to (268435456 / 65536) = 4096 pods on that host
without collision.

2.  By default, CRI-O uses systemd-managed cgroups for containers but K8s
    uses legacy cgroups. Thus, you must either configure CRI-O to use legacy
    cgroups or alternatively configure K8s to use systemd-managed cgroups.

To configure CRI-O to use legacy cgroups, use the following settings in
`/etc/crio/crio.conf`:

```toml
# Cgroup setting for conmon
#conmon_cgroup = "system.slice"
conmon_cgroup = "pod"

# Cgroup management implementation used for the runtime.
#cgroup_manager = "systemd"
cgroup_manager = "cgroupfs"
```

Then restart CRI-O:

```console
systemctl restart crio
```

Alternatively, to configure K8s to use systemd-managed cgroups, follow the steps
[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/configure-cgroup-driver/).

Either cgroup mode (legacy or systemd-managed) works with Sysbox.

If you hit problems when re-starting CRI-O, see the [troubleshooting doc](troubleshoot.md).

### Configuring K8s to use CRI-O

Once CRI-O is installed on the Kubernetes worker node, the next step is to
configure the Kubelet to use CRI-O. By default the Kubelet will use containerd.

The way you do this configuration depends on whether you are initializing K8s on
the worker node for the first time, or whether K8s is already installed and you
want to switch its runtime config from containerd to CRI-O.

Both of these are described below.

#### Configuring a new K8s worker node with CRI-O

If you are doing a fresh initialization of K8s on a worker node (i.e., you are
joining the worker node to a K8s cluster) then you are typically doing this with
the K8s [kubeadm][kubeadm] tool.

In this case initializing K8s to use CRI-O on the node is trivial. Simply
add the `--cri-socket="/var/run/crio/crio.sock"` option to the `kubeadm join`
command.

For example, assuming you've setup a K8s control plane node with:

```console
kubeadm init --kubernetes-version=v1.20.2 --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

You can get the command for worker nodes to join the cluster with:

```console
$ kubeadm token create --print-join-command 2> /dev/null
kubeadm join 192.168.121.5:6443 --token 86e4wc.nc2ru2agneshhxs3     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:f85bf08d95b318db3d3eb7c5f9601bd7b077bfa67dfc35862ccd8652162212c6
```

Then on each worker node, first [install kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/):

```console
sudo swapoff -a

sudo modprobe br_netfilter
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables"
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables"

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.20.2-00 kubeadm=1.20.2-00 kubectl=1.20.2-00
```

Now restart CRI-O (so that it picks up the K8s CNI):

```console
sudo systemctl restart crio
```

Finally join the worker node to the cluster (notice the `--cri-socket` option):

```console
kubeadm join 192.168.121.5:6443 --cri-socket="/var/run/crio/crio.sock" --token 86e4wc.nc2ru2agneshhxs3     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:f85bf08d95b318db3d3eb7c5f9601bd7b077bfa67dfc35862ccd8652162212c6
```

If all is good, then K8s will see the newly added worker node reach the "Ready"
state within a minute or so.

```console
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME        STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
k8s-node1   Ready    control-plane,master   3d19h   v1.20.2
k8s-node2   Ready    <none>                 3d4h    v1.20.2
```

#### Reconfiguring an existing K8s worker node with CRI-O

If you have a K8s worker node that was previously initialized (e.g., a worker
node on a GKE cluster) but you want to switch the container runtime from
containerd to CRI-O, then follow the steps below.

1.  Modify the `KUBELET_OPTS` environment variable defined in the
    `/etc/default/kubelet`. This variable dictates the command line options passed
    to Kubelet when it starts. You need to add CRI-O as the container runtime.

The following `sed` commands do this (must run as root):

```console
sed -i 's@--container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock@--container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///run/crio/crio.sock@g' /etc/default/kubelet
sed -i 's@--runtime-cgroups=/system.slice/containerd.service@--runtime-cgroups=/system.slice/crio.service@g' /etc/default/kubelet
```

2.  Restart the Kubelet systemd service:

```console
systemctl restart kubelet
```

3.  Verify the Kubelet is happy:

```console
systemctl status kubelet
```

4.  Verify K8s is happy (since kubelet was restarted).

```console
kubectl get nodes
```

If all is good, the worker node in which we just reconfigured the kubelet should
show up as "Ready" in the K8s node list.

## Sysbox Uninstallation

Sysbox removal from a host is done by reverting the installation steps. First
stop all Sysbox pods on the node (if necessary drain the node). Then
follow these steps:

*   Delete the k8s runtime class resource.

```console
kubectl delete runtimeclass sysbox-runc
```

*   Delete the "sysbox-deploy-k8s" daemonset:

```console
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nestybox/sysbox-pods-preview/master/k8s-manifests/daemonset/sysbox-deploy-k8s.yaml
```

*   Apply and delete the "sysbox-cleanup-k8s" daemonset (this is the one that
    actually removes Sysbox from the node and restarts CRI-O):

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nestybox/sysbox-pods-preview/master/k8s-manifests/daemonset/sysbox-cleanup-k8s.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nestybox/sysbox-pods-preview/master/k8s-manifests/daemonset/sysbox-cleanup-k8s.yaml
```

**NOTE: The sysbox-cleanup-k8s daemonset will remove Sysbox from the host and
restart CRI-O. Unfortunately this will temporarily disrupt all pods on the nodes
where Sysbox was installed, for up to 1 minute.**

Finally, remove the sysbox RBAC daemonset.

```console
$ kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nestybox/sysbox-pods-preview/master/k8s-manifests/rbac/sysbox-rbac.yaml
```

This will uninstall Sysbox from the nodes and remove the "sysbox-runtime=running" label from them.

If in addition to removing Sysbox you want to remove CRI-O from the node (e.g.,
go back to containerd), see the next section.

## CRI-O Uninstallation

If you installed CRI-O via the installation daemonset, follow these steps to remove it:

```console
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nestybox/sysbox-pods-preview/crio-deploy-k8s/k8s-manifests/daemonset/crio-deploy-k8s.yaml
```

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nestybox/sysbox-pods-preview/crio-deploy-k8s/k8s-manifests/daemonset/crio-cleanup-k8s.yaml
```

```console
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nestybox/sysbox-pods-preview/crio-deploy-k8s/k8s-manifests/daemonset/crio-cleanup-k8s.yaml
```

```console
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nestybox/sysbox-pods-preview/crio-deploy-k8s/k8s-manifests/rbac/crio-deploy-rbac.yaml
```

If you installed CRI-O manually, then you need to manually revert the steps in
section [Manual CRI-O Installation](#manual-cri-o-installation) above.
